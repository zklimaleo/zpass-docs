# System Actors

In zPass, trust and control pivot around three main players: the Issuer, the Holder, and the Verifier.&#x20;

The Issuer creates digitally signed credentials to establish a foundation of trust.&#x20;

Holders securely store these credentials and utilize zero-knowledge proofs to selectively substantiate their claims, increasing their autonomy.&#x20;

Verifiers serve as custodians of access, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to assess eligibility without requiring exposure to sensitive personal information.
