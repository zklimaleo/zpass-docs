# System Actors

#### In zPass, trust and control pivot around three players: _the Issuer, the Holder, and the Verifier._&#x20;

**The Issuer** creates digitally signed credentials to establish a foundation of trust.&#x20;

**The Holder** securely stores these credentials and utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to selectively substantiate their claims, increasing their autonomy.&#x20;

**The Verifier** serves as the custodian of access, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to assess eligibility without requiring exposure to sensitive personal information.
