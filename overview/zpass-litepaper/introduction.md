# Introduction

Identity verification offers protection against fraudulent activities, ensuring that an individual genuinely matches their claimed identity. The process can be as simple as presenting a library card to borrow books from a university library, or as intricate as confirming one's identity with a secret password, such as a PIN when using a debit or credit card.

With the rise in online transactions and the ever-evolving sophistication of identity fraud, there's an emergent need for robust digital identity verification. Modern businesses are increasingly leveraging these digital services, examining a broader range of data points. In scenarios like online financial transactions or managing sensitive personal data, digital verification not only mitigates the risk and costs associated with fraud but also ensures compliance with anti-money laundering regulations.

During these digital verification processes, individuals might be prompted to provide personal identification documents, including but not limited to passports, driver's licenses, and other governmental IDs. Sometimes, even biometric data, which can be both sensitive and intimate, is requested. Herein lies the challenge: How do we ensure robust identity verification while preserving the individual's right to privacy and ensuring data security?

Two pivotal aspects in this discourse are privacy and security. Privacy concerns the protection of personal information, granting individuals autonomy over their data collection, utilization, and distribution. On the other hand, security focuses on safeguarding this data, emphasizing trust and upholding user rights. In the digital age, striking the right balance between these two, along with reliable identity verification, is crucial.

Traditional identification systems, unfortunately, are often vulnerable to various cyber threats, such as Single Point-of-Failure (SPoF) vulnerabilities and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Such methods are not robust enough for today's demanding digital standards.

The zPass protocol emerges as a groundbreaking solution in the realm of digital identity. Integrated within the Aleo blockchain, zPass employs advanced zero-knowledge cryptography techniques. This offers users decentralized identity verification and anonymous credentials derived from existing identity documents. More impressively, it allows for selective attribute disclosure, prioritizing user privacy. In practice, zPass is setting a new gold standard for swift, private digital identity verification.
