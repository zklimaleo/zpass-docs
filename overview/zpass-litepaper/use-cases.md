### Benefits

**Security**: Decentralization through Aleo's blockchain eliminates single points of failure and minimizes the risk of mass data breaches.

**Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure that users can validate their credentials without revealing the actual data to verifiers.

**Compatibility**: zPass is designed for seamless integration with existing systems, accommodating complex identity requirements without needing adjustments from original issuing authorities.

By focusing on decentralized control, customizable verification, and interoperability, zPass is pioneering a more secure and private user identity experience.
