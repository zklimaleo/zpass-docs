# Powered by Aleo

Built on Aleo's blockchain, zPass inherits the cryptographic capabilities of the ZEXE (Zero-Knowledge Execution Environment) model. What sets ZEXE (and therefore Aleo) apart is its innovative use of zero-knowledge proofs, combined with the ability to move execution off-chain:

**Privacy through Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Zero-knowledge proofs allow users to confirm that a transaction is valid without exposing any of the details behind it. This is crucial for maintaining user privacy in zPass.

**Off-Chain Execution:** Aleo allows users to execute complex programs offline and then submit proof of this work to the blockchain. This reduces the load on the network, which in turn speeds up transactions on the network.

**Fast Verification:** Aleo’s design allows these proofs to be quickly verified by 3rd parties, making the process both fast and secure.

By leveraging Aleo's unique capabilities in zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain execution, zPass not only ensures a high level of privacy but also offers scalability and efficiency

This method gets over the limitations of previous, centralized methods and democratizes the authentication process. ZPass establishes a new benchmark by providing a privacy-preserving solution that satisfies the demands of the stakeholders in digital identity frameworks.  With Aleo as its foundation, zPass increases the privacy, auditability, and usability of digital identities—both online and across many platforms.&#x20;
