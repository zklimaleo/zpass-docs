# Architecture

zPass combines the capabilities of zero-knowledge proofs with the nuances of real-world identity, enabling secure interactions in the digital world.

Using Aleo as its base, zPass makes digital identities more secure and private, easy to audit, and flexible to useâ€” online and across different platforms.

Credential data is embedded into a record on the Aleo blockchain.

Utilizing Aleo's native encryption, credential information remains confidential.

This approach leverages the inherent security features of the Aleo blockchain to ensure both integrity and confidentiality.

_**This architecture offers:**_

**Security**: Decentralization through Aleo's blockchain eliminates single points of failure and minimizes the risk of mass data breaches.

**Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure that users can validate their credentials without revealing the actual data to verifiers.

**Compatibility**: zPass is designed for seamless integration with existing systems, accommodating complex identity requirements without needing adjustments from original issuing authorities.

By focusing on decentralized control, customizable verification, and interoperability, zPass is pioneering a more secure and private user identity experience.
