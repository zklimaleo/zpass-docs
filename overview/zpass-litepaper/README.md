# zPass

As of 2023, the World Wide Web is accessed by a staggering 5.18 billion internet users, encompassing nearly two-thirds of the global populace. This universality often comes at the cost of privacy. Users frequently authenticate attributes like age, nationality, passwords, PINs, or memberships to access various web resources. This begs the question -

**How can users authenticate and access products without compromising their privacy or divulging sensitive data?**

We introduce zPass, a system architected on Aleo's zero-knowledge platform and implemented in the Leo programming language.&#x20;

**zPass addresses the privacy-security challenge.**&#x20;

Web users often need to prove specific attributes about themselves, such as age, nationality, or membership. There is a growing need for those users to verify those attributes about themselves without risking their privacy or personal data.

This document introduces zPass, a solution that employs Aleo, the zero-knowledge developer platform and blockchain, and its domain-specific language, Leo, to generate programs that better protect privacy in identity verification.
