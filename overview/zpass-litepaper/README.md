# zPass

Navigating the balance between robust identity verification and user privacy is essential in an increasingly digital world. Traditional identity systems, vulnerable to DDoS and single-point failures, fall short in the modern threat landscape.&#x20;

In this paper, we present zPass, a protocol on the Aleo blockchain that uses zero-knowledge cryptographer to empower users with â€“

* Decentralized identity verification, reducing risks like insider threats or data breaches from unpatched vulnerabilities.
* Anonymous credentials from existing identity documents, streamlining real-world adoption without requiring protocol changes.
* Slective attribute disclosure for user privacy, allowing user to prove identity assertions over multiple credentials

In practice, zPass performs verifications in under Xms, setting a new standard for fast, privacy-preserving digital identity.
