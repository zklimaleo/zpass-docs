# Powered by Aleo

**Built on Aleo’s blockchain**, zPass inherits the cryptographic capabilities of the ZEXE (Zero-Knowledge EXEcution Environment) model. What sets ZEXE (and therefore Aleo) apart is its innovative use of zero-knowledge proofs, combined with the ability to move execution off-chain.

**Privacy through zero-knowledge proofs**: Zero-knowledge proofs allow users to confirm that a transaction is valid without exposing any of the details behind it. This is crucial for maintaining user privacy in zPass.

**Off-chain execution**: Aleo allows users to execute complex programs offline and then submit a ZKP of this work to the blockchain. This reduces the load on the network, which in turn speeds up transactions on the network.

**Fast verification**: Aleo’s design allows these proofs to be quickly verified by third parties, making the process both fast and secure.

## Benefits

**Security**: Decentralization through Aleo’s blockchain eliminates single points of failure and minimizes the risk of mass data breaches.

**Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) ensure that users can validate their credentials without revealing the actual data to verifiers.

**Compatibility**: zPass is designed for seamless integration with existing systems, accommodating complex identity requirements without needing adjustments from original issuing authorities.

By focusing on decentralized control, customizable verification, and interoperability, zPass is pioneering a more secure and private user identity experience.
