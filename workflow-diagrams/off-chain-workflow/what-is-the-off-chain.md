# What is the Off-Chain?

### **Incorporating External Credentials into zPass**

The off-chain flow refers to the operations that occur outside the Aleo blockchain. These operations, can either be initiated and completed off-chain or even have their beginnings outside the Aleo ecosystem altogether.

#### **Origin of Credentials: Beyond the Aleo Ecosystem**

While we have equipped developers with the capability to generate credentials within the Aleo environment, it's essential to grasp that a credential could very well originate from an external entity. A tangible example is a passport. Issued by national authorities, passports aren't native to the Aleo or any blockchain system. However, they bear native signatures, acting as proof of authenticity.

These native signatures allow external credentials like a passport to integrate into zPass. The external credential, when presented to an Aleo program, can be processed and verified without having to record details on the blockchain.
