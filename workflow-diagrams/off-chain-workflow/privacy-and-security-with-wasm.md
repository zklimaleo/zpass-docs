# Privacy and Security with WASM

One of Aleo's standout features is its use of WebAssembly (WASM). By leveraging WASM, Aleo ensures Holders can execute programs in a secure, local environment using their private inputs. This means the privacy of their information is never compromised, eliminating the need to trust a third-party entirely.
