# zPass

Navigating the balance between robust identity verification and user privacy is essential in an increasingly digital world. Traditional identity systems, vulnerable to DDoS and single-point failures, fall short in the modern threat landscape.&#x20;

In this paper, we present zPass, a protocol on the Aleo blockchain that uses zero-knowledge cryptography to empower users with:

* Decentralized identity verification, reducing risks like insider threats or data breaches from unpatched vulnerabilities.
* Anonymous credentials from existing identity documents, streamlining real-world adoption without requiring protocol changes.
* Selective attribute disclosure for user privacy, allowing users to prove identity assertions over multiple credentials.

zPass sets a new standard for fast, secure, and privacy-preserving digital identity.
