# What is On-Chain?

The on-chain flow in the Aleo ecosystem focuses on interactions that occur directly within the Aleo blockchain. These interactions serve to ensure a robust level of permissionless privacy and trust. This is in contrast to the off-chain flow, where operations might be initiated and completed outside of Aleo's purview.

Let's break it down into three main sections:&#x20;

**Credential Generation (Off-chain)**&#x20;

**Credential Issuance (On-chain)** &#x20;

In the on-chain process, Aleo serves as the trusted authority to issue digital credentials. These credentials are often the on-chain equivalents of real-world documents and are committed directly to the blockchain. This ensures a high level of data integrity and trust.

**Holder Presentation and Aleo Verification (On-chain)**

After the credentials have been issued and stored on-chain, the holder can present these credentials for various purposes within the Aleo ecosystem. Aleo's native programs then verify these credentials on-chain, ensuring a seamless and secure process.\
