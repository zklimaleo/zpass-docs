# Methods References

The ZPass SDK provides a comprehensive set of methods for interacting with ZPass credentials on the Aleo blockchain.

## Core Operations

### Credential Management

* [signcredential.md](signcredential.md "mention") - Sign credential data with a private key
* [issuezpass.md](issuezpass.md "mention") - Issue a new ZPass credential on-chain
* [getzpassrecord.md](getzpassrecord.md "mention") - Retrieve and decrypt a ZPass record from the blockchain

### Proof Operations

* [proveonchain.md](proveonchain.md "mention") - Generate an on-chain proof for a ZPass credential
* [proveoffchain.md](proveoffchain.md "mention") - Generate an off-chain proof locally
* [verifyonchain.md](verifyonchain.md "mention") - Verify an on-chain ZPass proof
* [verifyoffchain.md](verifyoffchain.md "mention") - Verify an off-chain ZPass proof locally

## Worker Management

* [createaleoworker.md](createaleoworker.md "mention") - Create a Web Worker for Aleo computations
* [initthreadpool.md](initthreadpool.md "mention") - Initialize a thread pool for improved performance
